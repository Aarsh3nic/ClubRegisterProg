# Club Registration Program

This Java program helps add new members to the Montr√©al Youth Soccer Club (MYSC).
Users can register up to 20 new members by entering their first name, last name, and birthdate.
After all members are added, the program sorts and displays the list of new members in alphabetical
order by their first and last names. It also shows who the youngest and oldest members are based on their birthdates.
This makes it easy to manage and organize new club members.
